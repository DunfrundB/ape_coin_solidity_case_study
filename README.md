# Ape-Coin:  A case study on how to live in the world of Cryptocurrecy.

## Introduction

A journey through space and time...  The countdown begins.  We developed an idea with many goals in mind.  Through hard work, determination and a sense of imagination our course was set with one destination in our sights, the moon!

Ape Coin is an ERC-20 conversion token structured on the Ethereum block chain.   What seperates APE from other crypto currencies is the unique feature of being backed with a 1:1 ratio with Bitcoin.  This provides traders, institutions and DApps a bridge to the ETH network while maintaining exposure to BTC.

## Analysis and Development

This project focuses on proof of concept for multiple topics within the smart contract & blockchain categories. As a team we were able to set up a functioning blockchain, generate/deploy a new token, construct a working dashboard with crytpo price charting data and develop a working website for the initial launch of our new crypto.  

We firmly beleive showcasing all of these skills and features to potential investors is the first step to changing the world of finance.
