# Ape-Coin:  A case study on how to live in the world of Cryptocurrecy.

## Introduction

A journey through space and time...  The countdown begins.  We developed an idea with many goals in mind.  Through hard work, determination and a sense of imagination our course was set with one destination in our sights, the moon!

Ape Coin is an ERC-20 conversion token structured on the Ethereum block chain.   What seperates APE from other crypto currencies is the unique feature of being backed with a 1:1 ratio with Bitcoin.  This provides traders, institutions and DApps a bridge to the ETH network while maintaining exposure to BTC.



## Analysis and Development

Our group is currently underway with this project.  Expected end date will be beginning of October 2021.
